Securing your rails app
================================================
  
  Reading
    Rails Guides - security

  General Points
    Trust nothing from the browser
    Database contains anything the user has entered, so malicious information may be in there.
    Stay up to date on security patches. Plugins, rails gem, etc. Don't bypass rail's built-in security measures.
    Do a security audit by a company that does them professionally.
    Be aware, think like a hacker.
  
  Session Key
    With patience, it can be brute forced to get the session digest. 
      Fix: Don't use a comparison function with the digest. http://codahale.com/a-lesson-in-timing-attacks/
      
  XSS
    Injected an image that sources to another server.
      Allowing users to enter in HTML can allow this to happen.
      Fix: Don't use raw (Dangerous). For HTML, use a whitelist - 
        Whitelist: Rails helper - sanitize. Accepts an array of tags, a string to sanitize, etc.
        
  Authentication != Authorization
    Simple solution, is grab records that the current user is connected to. has_many relationship.
    Cancan an authorization solution/gem.
    
  CSRF
    Using rest helps against false requests
    Rails 3+ checks for CSRF authenticity token. This is set when using the form_tag and form_for helpers
    XSS Bypasses this.
    
  Session spoofing
    Firesheep firefox addon that could grab cookies off users on the local network.
    Fix: SSL
    Secure cookies
    Strict-transport-security - Tells the server to only operate with a secure connection.
    How?: 
      Rack::SSL
