This is a collection of notes from some people who went to RailsConf 2011 in Baltimore. It is mostly just sort of typed as a stream of conciousness with some attempt to make some kind of whitspace-based organization.  They're not cleaned up and probably have typos and spelling errors. Feel free to do with these whatever you want.
