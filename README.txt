In 2011, I went to RailsConf in Baltimore. These are notes I made during some of
the talks I went to. I just sort of typed whatever I was thinking in the order I
was thinking it and tried to make some kind of whitspace-based organization.
They're not cleaned up and probably have typos and spelling errors. Feel free to
do with these whatever you want.
